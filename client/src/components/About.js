          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            Our Appointment Management System (AMS) is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline the appointment booking process for a wide range of organizations.

          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            AMS is built using the MERN stack, a popular technology stack for building dynamic web applications. The MERN stack consists of the following technologies:
          </Typography>
          <ul>
            <li>MySQL: A relational database management system used for storing structured data and ensuring data integrity through relationships between tables.</li>
            <li>Express.js: A minimalist web application framework for Node.js, used for building web servers and APIs.</li>
            <li>React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a fast and interactive frontend experience.</li>
            <li>Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows running JavaScript code server-side, enabling full-stack development with JavaScript.</li>
          </ul>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            However, instead of MongoDB, we have opted for MySQL as the database management system for AMS. MySQL is a popular relational database that offers scalability, reliability, and robust performance for handling large datasets and complex queries.
